    "**[Duel links](https://www.konami.com/yugioh/duel_links/en/)** is a game based on [speed duels](https://img.yugioh-card.com/uk/gameplay/detail.php?id=5618#:~:text=Speed%20Dueling%20is%20a%20specialised,Cards%2C%20and%20battle%20your%20opponent.), this means that there are only three slots for monster and three for spells/traps, and two extra slots for link monsters (one player can use only one slot, and can set links, fusion, sinchro or xyz monsters). In the game are playable characters, and can be used with their skills, some characters are capable to set two extra slots for pendulum cards, but this last feature is irrelevant for the purpose of this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This game use events, and fight against paradox is one of them. The event have certain [features](https://www.duellinksmeta.com/articles/events/november-2022/paradox-event), for example, some monsters can do attacks with multiplied damaged (x5), and the boss (paradox) have thousands of life points, reaching even 5 hundred thousand (it's the bigger life pints that i've seen). \n",
    "\n",
    "The fight against paradox includes another advantajes, for example, after complete 5 duels against the boss, you can play a [friendship duel](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Raid_Duel_-_Bonds_Beyond_Time:_Paradox_vs._The_Three_Duelists#Friendship_Duel) which bring habilities really useful, for example, summon (without requirements) black magician, elemental hero neos, or [Stardust Dragon](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Stardust_Dragon). You can use this habilities 4 times. The last hability is about sum the attack points of two monsters to another, and then double it's attack. Using the shooting star dragon, and it's hability, you can make a lot of damage.\n",

    "The last importan feature is one item used to draw two cards each turn instead one. This item, I gues is the key to get the most quantity of damage."
