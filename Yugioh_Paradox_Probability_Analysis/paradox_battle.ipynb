    "**[Paradox](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Paradox)** is a charater from the movie **[Yu-gi-oh! 3D: Bonds Beyond Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_Bonds_Beyond_Time)**. He confront the **three main characters** from the **three first yugioh series** (Yugioh, Yugioh GX and Yugioh 5D) and duel links takes advantaje from this movie creating a **kind of triple duel** with certain **rulez and skills**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Duel links](https://www.konami.com/yugioh/duel_links/en/)** is a game based on [speed duels](https://img.yugioh-card.com/uk/gameplay/detail.php?id=5618#:~:text=Speed%20Dueling%20is%20a%20specialised,Cards%2C%20and%20battle%20your%20opponent.), this means that there are only three slots for monster and three for spells/traps, and two extra slots for link monsters (one player can use only one slot, and can set links, fusion, sinchro or xyz monsters). In the game are playable characters, and can be used with their skills, some characters are capable to set two extra slots for pendulum cards, but this last feature is irrelevant for the purpose of this analysis. The maximum cards for deck is 30, and the minimum is 20. 20 cards decks have better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This game use events, and fight against paradox is one of them. The event have certain [features](https://www.duellinksmeta.com/articles/events/november-2022/paradox-event), for example, some monsters can do attacks with multiplied damaged (x5), and the boss (paradox) have thousands of life points, reaching even 5 hundred thousand (it's the bigger life pints that i've seen). \n",
    "\n",
    "The fight against paradox includes another advantajes, for example, after complete 5 duels against the boss, you can play a [friendship duel](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Raid_Duel_-_Bonds_Beyond_Time:_Paradox_vs._The_Three_Duelists#Friendship_Duel) which bring habilities really useful, for example, summon (without requirements) black magician, elemental hero neos, or [Stardust Dragon](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Stardust_Dragon). You can use this habilities 4 times. The last hability is about sum the attack points of two monsters to another, and then double it's attack. Using the shooting star dragon, and it's hability, you can make a lot of damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last importan feature is one item used to draw two cards each turn instead one. This item, I gues is the key to get the most quantity of damage."

Then use the duel skill to summon stardust dragon, then use the skill of Yusei to summon Shooting Star Dragon (SSD).

    "Now lets think about this: every time the player fights against Paradox, this last one plays first, hence, the player always goes second. Regarding this, the first hand always is five cards. Then, the permutations change like this: ${}_{5} P_{3}$ and this is equal to: 10. Therefore, the probability to take three Power of The guardian is: $\\frac{10}{4845} = 0.00206398348813$. Probability increases."
