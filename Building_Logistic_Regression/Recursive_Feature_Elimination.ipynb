    "For **classification** with **small training samples** and **high dimensionality**, feature selection plays an important role in avoiding **overfitting** problems and **improving classification performance**. One of the commonly used feature selection methods for small samples problems is **Recursive Feature Elimination** (RFE) method. RFE method utilizes the generalization capability embedded in **support vector machines** and is thus suitable for small **samples problems**. Despite its good performance, RFE tends to discard “weak” features, which may provide a significant improvement of performance when combined with other features. \n",
